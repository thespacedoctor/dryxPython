	<string># Sermon, Stephen McCory

## Church ##

* Evangelism is always in twos.
* Paul expected the people that came to the Lord to be in community.
* We are called to meet together and it is assumed that we will meet together.
* [Ephesians 5](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/eph.3.esv) - the body of Christ, the church, is a profound mystery. 
* We can find out more about mysteries via prayer than from any books.
* The more you know the more there is to find out.</string>

>There is an obvious Great Disparity between, on the one hand, the hope for life expressed in Jesus—found real in the Bible and in many shining examples from among his followers—and, on the other hand, the actual day-to-day behavior, inner life, and social presence of most of those who now profess adherence to him. 

---

>We must approach current disappointments about the walk with Christ in a similar way. It too is not meant to run on just anything you may give it. If it doesn’t work at all, or only in fits and starts, that is because we do not give ourselves to it in a way that allows our lives to be taken over by it.

---

>If we do seek him, he will certainly find us, and then we, ever more deeply, find him. That is the blessed existence of the disciple of Jesus who continuously “grows in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:18).

---

>A disciple is a learner, a student, an apprentice—a practitioner, even if only a beginner.

---

>disciples of Jesus are people who do not just profess certain views as their own but apply their growing understanding of life in the Kingdom of the Heavens to every aspect of their life on earth.

---

>the governing assumption today, among professing Christians, is that we can be “Christians” forever and never become disciples.

---

>And this (with its various consequences) is the Great Omission from the “Great Commission” in which the Great Disparity is firmly rooted.

---

>Jesus told us explicitly what to do. We have a manual, just like the car owner. He told us, as disciples, to make disciples. Not converts to Christianity, nor to some particular “faith and practice.” He did not tell us to arrange for people to “get in” or “make the cut” after they die, nor to eliminate the various brutal forms of injustice, nor to produce and maintain “successful” churches. These are all good things, and he had something to say about all of them. They will certainly happen if—but only if—we are (his constant apprentices) and do (make constant apprentices) what he told us to be and do. If we just do this, it will little matter what else we do or do not do.

---

>Once we who are disciples have assisted others with becoming disciples (of Jesus, not of us), we can gather them, in ordinary life situations, under the supernatural Trinitarian Presence, forming a new kind of social unit never before seen on earth.

---

>Their “walk” is already “in heaven” (Philippians 3:20), because heaven is in action where they are (Ephesians 2:6).

---

>In becoming his students or apprentices, they have agreed to be taught, and the resources are available, so they can methodically go about doing it. This reliably yields the life that proves to “exceed all expectations.”

---

>People in Western churches, and especially in North America, usually assume without thinking that the Great Commission of Jesus is something to be carried out in other countries. This is caused in part by the use of “nations” to translate, when a better translation might be our contemporary “ethnic groups,” or just “people of every kind.” But this leads in practice to not treating “our kind of people” as the ones to be led into discipleship to Jesus.

---

>Our responsibility is to implement the Great Commission right where we are, not just to raise efforts to do it elsewhere. And if we don’t, it won’t even be implemented “over there.”

---

>The outward effect of this life in Christ is perpetual moral revolution, until the purpose of humanity on earth is completed.

---

>The mission naturally flows from the life.

---

>The eternal life, from which many profound and glorious effects flow, is interactive relationship with God and with his special Son, Jesus, within the abiding ambience of the Holy Spirit.

Note: @Action Edit
For at least several decades the churches of the Western world have not made discipleship a condition of being a Christian. One is not required to be, or to intend to be, a disciple in order to become a Christian, and one may remain a Christian without any signs of progress toward or in discipleship.

---

>One is not required to be, or to intend to be, a disciple in order to become a Christian, and one may remain a Christian without any signs of progress toward or in discipleship.

---

>So far as the visible Christian institutions of our day are concerned, discipleship clearly is optional.

---

>Churches are filled with “undiscipled disciples,”

---

>Most problems in contemporary churches can be explained by the fact that members have never decided to follow Christ.

---

>A different model of life was instituted in the “Great Commission” Jesus left for his people. The first goal he set for the early church was to use his all-encompassing power and authority to make disciples without regard to ethnic distinctions—from all “nations” (Matthew 28:19). That made clear a world-historical project and set aside his earlier strategic directive to go only to “the lost sheep of the house of Israel” (Matthew 10:6). Having made disciples, these alone were to be baptized into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Given this twofold preparation, they were then to be taught to treasure and keep “all things whatsoever I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:20). The Christian church of the first centuries resulted from following this plan for church growth—a result hard to improve upon.

---

>in place of Christ’s plan, historical drift has substituted “Make converts (to a particular ‘faith and practice’) and baptize them into church membership.”

---

>we start by omitting the making of disciples and enrolling people as Christ’s students, when we should let all else wait for that. Then we also omit, of necessity, the step of taking our converts through training that will bring them ever-increasingly to do what Jesus directed.

---

>Family and occupations were deserted for long periods to go with Jesus as he walked from place to place announcing, showing, and explaining the here-and-now governance or action of God. Disciples had to be with him to learn how to do what he did. Imagine doing that today. How would family members, employers, and co-workers react to such abandonment? Probably they would conclude that we did not much care for them, or even for ourselves. Did not Zebedee think this as he watched his two sons desert the family business to keep company with Jesus (Mark 1:20)? Ask any father in a similar situation.

---

>“it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher” (Matthew 10:25). And moreover, “everyone who is fully qualified will be like the teacher” (Luke 6:40).

---

>A mind cluttered by excuses may make a mystery of discipleship, or it may see it as something to be dreaded. But there is no mystery about desiring and intending to be like someone—that is a very common thing. And if we really do intend to be like Christ, that will be obvious to every thoughtful person around us, as well as to ourselves.

---

>the cost of nondiscipleship is far greater—even when this life alone is considered—than the price paid to walk with Jesus, constantly learning from him.

IF WE ARE CHRISTIANS simply by believing that Jesus died for our sins, then that is all it takes to have sins forgiven and go to heaven when we die. Why, then, do some people keep insisting that something more than this is desirable? Lordship, discipleship, spiritual formation, and the like?

---

>there is absolutely nothing in what Jesus himself or his early followers taught that suggests you can decide just to enjoy forgiveness at Jesus’s expense and have nothing more to do with him.

---

>A. W. Tozer expressed his “feeling that a notable heresy has come into being throughout evangelical Christian circles—the widely accepted concept that we humans can choose to accept Christ only because we need him as Savior and that we have the right to postpone our obedience to him as Lord as long as we want to!”1 He then goes on to state “that salvation apart from obedience is unknown in the sacred scriptures.”

---

>“Spiritual formation” in the Christian tradition is a process of increasingly being possessed and permeated by such character traits as we walk in the easy yoke of discipleship with Jesus our teacher.

---

>for the one who makes sure to walk as close to Jesus as possible there comes the reliable exercise of a power that is beyond them in dealing with the problems and evils that afflict earthly existence.

>Note: @Action Edit
What happens to Jesus in the crush of the information pushers? Unfortunately, he is usually pushed aside. Many Christians do not even think of him as one with reliable information about their lives. Consequently they do not become his students.

>Then he invites us to follow him into his practices, such as solitude, silence, study, service, worship, etc.—we call them “spiritual disciplines.” There, with him, the readinesses to do evil that inhabit our bodily members through long practice are gradually removed, to an ever-increasing degree.

---

>As disciples (literally students) of Jesus, our goal is to learn to be like him.

---

>Heaven is a deeply significant word. From Abraham (Genesis 24:7) onward, it signified to the people of Israel the direct availability of God to his children, as well as his supremacy over all that affects us. From heaven, “the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry” (Psalm 34:15; also 1 Peter 3:12).

>Opening Our Lives to the Spirit

>living in the Spirit allows us to “walk in” the Spirit

---

>The presence of the Holy Spirit can always be recognized by the way He moves us toward what Jesus would be and do (John 16:7–15).

---

>Outwardly, life in the Spirit manifests itself in two ways. Gifts of the Spirit will enable us to perform some specific function—such as service or healing or leading worship—with effects clearly beyond those of our own making. These gifts serve God’s purposes among His people, but they do not necessarily signify the state of our heart. The fruit of the Spirit, in contrast, gives a sure sign of transformed character. When our deepest attitudes and dispositions are those of Jesus, it is because we have learned to let the Spirit foster his life in us.

---

>Both gifts and fruit are the result, not the reality, of the Spirit’s presence in our lives. What brings about our transformation into Christ-likeness is our direct, personal interaction with Christ through the Spirit.

---

>The Disciplines of Christ-likeness

---

>The third side of our triangle is made up of spiritual disciplines.

---

>They are ways in which we undertake to follow the New Testament mandate to put to death or “make no provision for” the merely earthly aspects of our lives and to put on the new person (Colossians 3:9–10; Ephesians 4:22–24).

---

>We should not only want to be merciful, kind, unassuming, and patient persons but also be making plans to become so.

---

>Haste has worry, fear, and anger as close associates; it is a deadly enemy of kindness, and hence of love.

---

>We will come to understand that for the most part our hurry is really based upon pride, self-importance, fear, and lack of faith, and rarely upon the production of anything of true value for anyone.

---

>we take note of and follow Jesus in what he did when he was not ministering or teaching, we will find ourselves led and enabled to behave as he did when he was “on the spot.”1

Do all you have to do without complaint or wrangling. Show yourselves guileless and above reproach, faultless children of God in a warped and crooked generation, in which you shine like stars in a dark world” (Philippians 2:12–15).

>There is, of course, no question of doing this purely on our own. But we must act. Grace is opposed to earning, not to effort.

>Grace is opposed to earning, not to effort. And it is well-directed, decisive, and sustained effort that is the key to the keys of the Kingdom and to the life of restful power in ministry and life that those keys open to us.

---

>it is well-directed, decisive, and sustained effort that is the key to the keys of the Kingdom and to the life of restful power in ministry and life that those keys open to us.

---

>We must understand that He is in charge of the outcome of our efforts, and that the outcome will be good, right. And all of this is encompassed in one biblical term, “Sabbath.”

---

>Sabbath is a way of life (Hebrews 4:3, 9–11). It sets us free from bondage to our own efforts.

---

>Very practically, Sabbath is simply “casting all your anxiety on Him,” to find that in actual fact “He cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7; see also Psalm 37:3–8).

---

>Three practices or spiritual disciplines are especially helpful in making Sabbath real in the midst of our life: solitude, silence, and fasting. These are three of the central disciplines of abstinence long practiced by the followers of Jesus to help them find and keep a solid footing in the Kingdom that cannot be moved—in the midst of a busy and productive life, or even a life of trial, conflict, and frustration.

---

>Sabbath will not become possible without extensive, regular practice of solitude.

---

>But we must not try to get God to “do something” to fill up our time. That will only throw us back into work. The command is “Do no work.” Just make space. Attend to what is around you. Learn that you don’t have to do to be. Accept the grace of doing nothing. Stay with it until you stop jerking and squirming.

---

>Silence also brings Sabbath to you. Silence means quietness, freedom from sounds except natural ones like breathing, bird songs, and wind and water gently moving. It also means not talking. Silence completes solitude, for without it you cannot be alone.

---

>God does not ordinarily compete for our attention. In silence we come to attend.

---

>we are not safe and rich in talk and companionship unless our souls are strong in solitude and silence.

---

>“As I have slowed my life down through silence and solitude, I have discovered both the wickedness hidden by a hurried life as well as the wonder and delight my Father has in me. Oddly, through intentional times of practicing spiritual disciplines, my walk with Jesus has become more spontaneous. He is present in more of my day. I have loved others better, and seen progress made in overcoming anger and the desire to have things my way. In a nutshell, Jesus has greater access to and control over my life. I’m more in tune to the still small voice of the Spirit.”

---

>Experimental, prayerful implementation of solitude, silence, fasting—and other appropriate practices, such as service, fellowship, worship, and study (there is no such thing as a complete list of spiritual disciplines)—will certainly liberate us into the riches of Kingdom living. They are the key to the keys.

>CHAPTER 6 Spiritual Formation in Christ Is for the Whole Life and the Whole Person

---

>In the case of theological integrity and spiritual vitality, I think the idea is that you really can’t have the one without the other.

---

>The missing note in evangelical life today is not in the first instance spirituality but rather obedience.

---

>life in Christ has to do with obedience to his teaching. If we don’t start there, we may as well forget about any distinctively Christian spirituality.

---

>What then is spirit? Spirit is unbodily personal reality and power.

---

>Biblically, it is God who is, paradigmatically, unbodily personal power.

---

>Everything that is bodily—the physical universe in whole and in part—comes from Him and depends upon Him. Spirit can enter into and act with body (as is also the case with the human spirit), but it is not from body, even in the human case. It does not derive from the physical.

---

>Spirit can enter into and act with body (as is also the case with the human spirit), but it is not from body, even in the human case. It does not derive from the physical.

---

>Spirit is personal, not impersonal. None of that “the force be with you” stuff is relevant here.

---

>the personal nature of spirit is seen at its highest and clearest in the Trinitarian nature of God.

---

>Spirituality and spiritual formation are whole life matters. A “spiritual life” for the human being consists in that range of activities in which, being brought to spiritual birth by God’s initiative through the Word, he or she cooperatively interacts with God and with the spiritual order (“kingdom”) deriving from God’s personality and action. The result is a new overall quality of human existence with corresponding new powers. A person is a “spiritual person” to the degree that his or her life is effectively integrated into and dominated by God’s Kingdom or rule. For the “babe in Christ,” much of their embodied and concretely socialized personality is not under the direction of God, and the reintegration of their whole life under God is not yet achieved.

---

>The problem comes when we mistake the vessel for the treasure, for the treasure is the life and power of Jesus Christ. We have to have a form of life, a vessel, a “spirituality,” if you wish. None of us are given to be entirely spiritual beings now.

---

>Spiritual disciplines are activities in our power that we engage in to enable us to do what we cannot do by direct effort. The singing of hymns, for example, is a major spiritual discipline. I refer not just to singing them in church, but to singing them throughout our daily life.

---

>We need to say, under this fourth point—that Christian spirituality is supernatural and focused on obedience to Christ—that when we come to sing our hymns, we must keep our mind and will alive to what we are singing. Only so will the outcome be supernatural.

---

>spiritual formation is the process whereby the inmost being of the individual takes on the quality or character of Jesus himself.

---

>God is looking for those who worship him in truth and in spirit. We cannot fake before God. We should remember that God looks on the heart, man looks on the outward appearance. To focus on action alone is to fall into pharisaism of the worst kind and to kill the soul.

---

>We cannot fake before God. We should remember that God looks on the heart, man looks on the outward appearance.

---

>If you would draw a circle about the size of a half-dollar on a piece of paper and write in it the words “spirit,” “heart,” and “will.” And then around that draw another circle and label it “mind,” including thought and feeling. The third circle is “body.” The fourth circle is “social relations.” Your final circle is your soul. So you have spirit (will), mind (thoughts and feelings), body, social relations, and soul.3

---

>spiritual formation is a matter of reworking all aspects of the self.

---

>Spiritual formation is not a matter of just the spirit or heart, nor even of the soul, nor of outward behavior. The spirit, heart, or will is the executive center of the self. It is where action ultimately comes from, and it is absolutely fundamental. But it does not operate in isolation from the mind, from the body, from the social relationships, and from the soul, nor they from it. It operates in dependence on them. So, now, if we are going to do spiritual formation, we have to work on all of those aspects of the human being.

---

>We like to quote verses like, “Without Me you can do nothing,” which is absolutely true. But we forget that if you do nothing, it will be without Me.

---

>Bible memorization is absolutely fundamental to spiritual formation.

---

>Bible memorization is a fundamental way of filling our minds with what they need.

>These are just a few quick illustrations of how the overall transformation of the self comes about in the process of spiritual formation.

---

>the aim of spiritual formation is the transformation of the self, and that it works through transformation of thought, transformation of feeling, transformation of social relations, transformation of the body, and transformation of the soul.

---

>Grace is not opposed to effort, it is opposed to earning. Earning is an attitude. Effort is an action.

---

>You will consume much more grace by leading a holy life than you will by sinning, because every holy act you do will have to be upheld by the grace of God.

---

>if we divide between justification and regeneration in such a way that the gospel is only “Believe Jesus died for your sins and you will go to heaven when you die,” we are stuck with a theology that is inherently resistant to a vital spirituality.

---

>Generally expressed, baptism in the Spirit, spiritual experiences, high acts of worship, and other experiences of worship do not transform character. They just don’t do it. I am one who has had glorious experiences, and who owes much to them. They have a special role in the spiritual life. I don’t talk about the experiences I have had because I think they are between me and the Lord, and, in any case, they are to be known by their effects. They have meant a lot to me, but they have not transformed my character.

---

>CHAPTER 7 Spiritual Formation in Christ A Perspective on What It Is and How It Might Be Done

---

>Everyone receives spiritual formation, just as everyone gets an education. The only question is whether it is a good one or a bad one. We need to take a conscious, intentional hand in the developmental process.

---

>Gerald G. May writes, “Spiritual formation is a rather general term referring to all attempts, means, instructions, and disciplines intended towards deepening of faith and furtherance of spiritual growth. It includes educational endeavors as well as the more intimate and in-depth process of spiritual direction.”1

---

>It is useful, therefore, to speak of spiritual formation by distinguishing three different meanings or moments. First, identifying certain activities as spiritual work or exercise, one can think of spiritual formation as training in these special spiritual activities.

---

>identifying certain activities as spiritual work or exercise, one can think of spiritual formation as training in these special spiritual activities.

---

>“priestly formation,”

---

>Second, spiritual formation may be thought of as the shaping of the inner life, the spirit, or the spiritual side of the human being.

---

>Third, spiritual formation may be thought of as a shaping by the spirit or by the spiritual realm, and by the Holy Spirit and other spiritual agencies involved in the Kingdom of God, especially the Word of God.

---

>Spiritual formation in Christ is oriented toward explicit obedience to Christ.

---

>The language of the Great Commission, in Matthew 28, makes it clear that our aim, our job description as Christ’s people, is to bring disciples to the point of obedience to “all things whatsoever that I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:20). Of course, this assumes that we ourselves are in obedience, having learned how to obey Christ. Though the inner dynamics are those of love for Christ, he left no doubt that the result would be the keeping of his commandments. “They who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them” (John 14:21).

---

>of course, spiritual formation in this sense cannot be done by focusing just on actions or practices. That way leads to legalism, failure, and death, as Jesus made very clear in his “Sermon on the Mount” (Matthew 5:20). But this does not mean we must surrender the behavioral aim set up by Christ himself. We teach people to do “all things whatsoever” by shaping their hearts to love Christ and his commandments, and by training their entire personality (soul, mind, body, and to some degree even environment) to side with their new heart or spirit, which is the creative element of the self that we also call the will. To will (thelein; Romans 7:18) is not just important, it is unavoidable. But the person acts, and more is involved in action than willing.

>At the core of the human being is will, spirit, and heart. This core is reshaped, opening out to the reshaping of the whole life, only by engagement.

---

>CHAPTER 8 The Spirit Is Willing, But… The Body as a Tool for Spiritual Growth

---

>SPIRITUAL FORMATION is the process through which those who love and trust Jesus Christ effectively take on his character. When this process is what it should be, they increasingly live their lives as he would if he were in their place.

---

>The Body and the Spiritual Life

---

>Probably the least understood aspect of progress in Christ-likeness is the role of the body in the spiritual life.

---

>Through the power of God which raised Christ from the dead, Paul tells us, “your bodies are members of Christ” (1 Corinthians 6:15). Our bodies do not even belong to us, but have been bought by Christ, who gives them a life “from above” and opens the way for us “to glorify God in [our bodies]” (1 Corinthians 6:20). Thus, we can “present [our] bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,” this being our “spiritual worship” (Romans 12:1).

---

>Human Nature

---

>When we come to new life in Christ, our bodies and their deformed desire system do not automatically shift to the side of Christ, but continue to oppose him.

---

>Christ-likeness Must Be Planned For

---

>nowadays the task of becoming Christ-like is rarely taken as a serious objective to be thoughtfully planned for, and the reality of our embodied personality dealt with accordingly.

---

>it truly is “by the spirit” that we “put to death the misdeeds of the body.” The natural desires, and my body itself, remain with me, of course, but now as servants of God and of my will to serve Him, not as my masters.

---

>When Direct Effort Fails

---

>Often when we come to do the right thing we have already done the wrong thing, because that is what was sitting in our body “at the ready.” Intention alone cannot suffice in most situations where we find ourselves. We must be “in shape.”

---

>our intention and effort must be carried into effect by training which leaves our body poised to do what Christ would do, well before the occasion arises. Such training is supplied by the disciplines for life in the Spirit.

---

>How We Can Change

---

>And how would we do it? First, we begin by acknowledging the good of what we are going to do and asking God’s assistance. Second, we begin to practice controlling our tongue. Not by trying not to insult people when they shake us up. No, we begin further back from the target situation. Possibly we step out of the realm of words by not speaking for a twenty-four-hour period—even by dwelling in silence with the TV and radio off. This probably will require that we go into solitude for the period of time.

---

>the body is the place of our direct power. It is the little “power pack” that God has assigned to us as the field of our freedom and development.

>Some may think it strange that such practices, the disciplines for life in the Spirit, are all bodily behaviors. But it cannot be otherwise. Learning Christ-likeness is not passive. It is active engagement with and in God. And we act with our bodies.

---

>CHAPTER 9 Living in the Vision of God

---

>So we can summarize the process by which the mission and its goals replace the original vision as the ultimate point of reference for the people involved. Vision of God and of oneself in God inspires a combination of humility and great aspiration for God. This combination leads to remarkable efforts in dependence upon God. Great effects are achieved because God acts with efforts made in dependence upon him and for his sake. The effects take on a life of their own. Surrounding people see nothing but the effects, which indeed are very remarkable and worthy of support. Sometimes the human support may also be of God. But the effects of all this have to be carefully watched, to prevent them from corrupting the heart away from an appropriate vision of God and the humble valor flowing therefrom.

---

>It is a matter of identifying and sustaining the sense or vision of God, self, and world that pervaded and animated the originators.

---

>CHAPTER 10 Idaho Springs Inquiries Concerning Spiritual Formation

---

>What is spiritual formation? How is it to be described in the language of contemporary life?

---

>Spiritual formation, without regard to any specifically religious context or tradition, is the process by which the human spirit or will is given a definite form, or character.

---

>Christian spiritual formation, in contrast, is the redemptive process of forming the inner human world so that it takes on the character of the inner being of Christ himself.

---

>What is the relationship between spiritual formation and salvation? How is grace involved with spiritual formation?

---

>CHAPTER 11 Personal Soul Care For Ministers…And Others

---

>THE CALL OF GOD to minister the gospel is both a high honor and a noble challenge. It carries with it unique opportunities as well as special burdens and dangers for members of the clergy as well as their families. These burdens can be fruitfully borne and the dangers triumphantly overcome. But that will not happen unless the minister’s “inner person” (2 Corin thi ans 4:16) is constantly renewed by accessing the riches of God and His Kingdom in the inner person.

---

>God is greatly concerned with the quality of character we are building. The future He has planned for us will be built on the strength of character we forge by His grace.

---

>Practicing the Presence of God

---

>The first and most basic thing we can and must do is to keep God before our minds. David knew this secret and wrote, “I keep the Lord always before me; because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my soul rejoices; my body also rests secure” (Psalm 16:8–9).

---

>Love and Worship

---

>As the Living Word and the written Word occupy our minds we naturally—and supernaturally—come to love God more and more because we see, clearly and constantly, how lovely He is.

---

>Opening to the Fullness of Joy

---

>Joy is not pleasure, a mere sensation, but a pervasive and constant sense of well-being. Hope in the goodness of God is joy’s indispensable support.

---

>Solitude and Silence

---

>We practice these by finding ways to be alone and away from talk and noise. We rest, we observe, we “smell the roses”—dare we say it?—we do nothing. This discipline can be used of God as a means of grace. In it we may even find another reminder of grace—that we are saved, justified by His redeeming power, not by our strivings and achievements.

---

>Time Is Made, Not Found

---

>No time is more profitably spent than that used to heighten the quality of an intimate walk with God.

---

>will we take time to do what is necessary for an abundant life and an abundant ministry, or will we try to get by without it?

---

>Planning for Fullness of Life

---

>DISCIPLESHIP OF THE SOUL AND THE MIND

---

>CHAPTER 12 Spiritual Disciplines, Spiritual Formation, and the Restoration of the Soul

---

>A Renewed Interest in Spirituality

---

>there is much interest in spiritual disciplines and the process of spiritual formation. This derives from a sense of our urgent need for mental and emotional health, as well as spiritual depth,

---

>Assumptions for This Discussion

---

>the human soul must be treated as an entity in its own right, with its own peculiar nature and relationships.

---

>A person is a living entity that has a certain kind of life: primarily one of self-determination in terms of adopted values, with the possibility (and vital need) of worship.

---

>The soul is that entity within a person that integrates all of the components of his or her life into their life, one life.

---

>Descriptive Distinctions Within the Human Being

---

>Soul as Source and Coordinating Principle of Life

---

>The most illuminating and rational way of thinking about the soul is to regard it as that component of the total person that coordinates all of the capacities and dimensions of the human being and leads to their interactive development to form an individual life.

---

>The Classical View

---

>The soul is thought of by them as the source of life within the individual, and simultaneously as its ordering principle.

---

>The Biblical Picture

---

>A Useful Analogy

---

>The Soul Distanced from the Person

---

>Sin as Psychological Reality

---

>The “Light” of the Gospel

---

>Becoming Active in Spiritual Growth

---

>Planning for Routine Progress in Wholeness

---

>Spiritual Formation

---

>Spiritual formation, as commonly referred to nowadays, is a matter of reforming the broken soul of man in a recovery from its alienation from God. Really, it is soul reformation.

---

>The spirit in man is not the soul, but is the central part of the soul, the power of self-determination. It is the heart or will: the power, embedded in the soul, of choosing.

---

>CHAPTER 13 Christ-Centered Piety The Heart of the Evangelical

---

>When you try to “bless those who curse you,” for example, trying will prove never to be enough; you have to be trained for that. Such training comes under the area of discipleship, but today, generally speaking, we have separated faith in Christ from obedience or fulfillment. There is no available bridge to get from one to the other. That bridge would, of course, be discipleship. If you want to do what Jesus said, you direct your efforts at growing into the kind of person who would, naturally, do those things.

---

>Discipline is something we do to enable ourselves to accomplish what we cannot do by direct effort.

---

>CHAPTER 14 Why?

---

>Why should we practice the disciplines?

---

>The short answer and the absolute truth is that without discipline nothing of any value can be accomplished. This remains true in the spiritual life with Christ.

---

>CHAPTER 15 Jesus the Logician

---

>A PARTING WORD: “AS YOU GO…”

---

>If we wish to convert the church and the world, we begin with ourselves.

---

>He did tell us that, when filled with him, we would bear witness of him “to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1:8). Witnesses are those who cause others to know. They wit-ness. They are not manipulators—no need of that—though what they do is radically transformative.

---

>My first step then, “as I go,” is to be his disciple, and constantly to be learning from him how to live my life in the Kingdom of God now—my real life, the one I am actually living.

---

>Once we are disciples with some substance of the Christ-life, the person of Jesus himself, then we are in position to “bear wit-ness,” to bring others to know, to bring them to awareness of reality.

---

>But must we not do something about our situation in this world? No doubt we must, and many good opportunities will certainly present themselves to us. Do them the best you can. Just don’t take it upon yourself to carry the load, to make it happen. Always keep in mind who is really in charge of the greater scene—it isn’t you or me. Be humble before others as well as before God—especially before those who are sure we are wrong.

---

>Most important, don’t allow your thoughts and efforts to change things to come before or take the place of your practice of discipleship, walking with Jesus. That is to be your constant preoccupation, and what comes of it will wit-ness to and powerfully influence others around you. This is the sure path to changing things, in the church or in the world.

---

>You cannot privatize the fire of God that burns through the life of a disciple of Jesus. This was Jesus’s point in saying that “a city built on a hill cannot be hid,” and that one does not “light a candle and put it under a bushel” (Matthew 5:14–15; Mark 4:21; Luke 11:33).
